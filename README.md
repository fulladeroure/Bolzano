# Bolzano
Calculates function roots via Bolzano's theorem (Scala file)

Bolzano's theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem

The method 'bolzano' takes as parameters the continuous function of which we want to find the root; 'a' and 'b', which are the interval bounds; and 'e', the error.
